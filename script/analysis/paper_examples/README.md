This folder contains simulation and analysis examples that will allow the user to reproduce figures 4-11. As trajectory files can be quite large, most of these require the user to generate the data themselves, which can take some time.  If these simulations take too long for you, try turning the number of steps and increasing the rate at which configurations are saved by editing the input files.  This will limit the utility of the obtained data as the structures may no longer be decorrelated, however they will still work as examples.

The following examples run on the CUDA version of oxDNA which requires a UNIX computer with a GPU:
 * [angles](https://github.com/sulcgroup/oxdna_analysis_tools/tree/master/paper_examples/angles "angles")
 * [distances](https://github.com/sulcgroup/oxdna_analysis_tools/tree/master/paper_examples/distances "distances")
 * [mds_mean](https://github.com/sulcgroup/oxdna_analysis_tools/tree/master/paper_examples/mds_mean "mds_mean")
 * [svd_mean](https://github.com/sulcgroup/oxdna_analysis_tools/tree/master/paper_examples/svd_mean "svd_mean")

The following examples run on the CPU version of oxDNA which will run on any UNIX computer:
 * [h_bonds](https://github.com/sulcgroup/oxdna_analysis_tools/tree/master/paper_examples/h_bonds "h_bonds")
 * [PCA](https://github.com/sulcgroup/oxdna_analysis_tools/tree/master/paper_examples/PCA "PCA")

The following example contains a trajectory which was generated by the authors:
 * [clustering](https://github.com/sulcgroup/oxdna_analysis_tools/tree/master/paper_examples/clustering "clustering")
